# disturbute
Disturbute binary file(cli app)

## Getting started

For homebrew and apt you need to create a github release(or push you binary file as a tar file in any other fileserver)

### homebrew
1. create a github repositry named homebrew-appName 
2. put a rb file like [this](https://github.com/utopiops/homebrew-utopiops/releases) in your repository
* rb file is a homebrew formula 
3. now you can install your app with `brew [github-userName]/[appName]/[name-of-rb-file]`
* If you want to install with `brew appName` you need to use homebrew-core (if your app is open-source) or cask. For more information visit [here](https://github.com/utopiops/homebrew-utopiops/releases)

### apt


### npm
